## Fibonacci Program using native approach
n = int(input("Print how many numbers you want to print in the series: "))
num1 = 0
num2 = 1
next_number = num2
count = 1

while count <= n:
    print(next_number, end=" ")
    count += 1
    num1, num2 = num2, next_number
    next_number = num1 + num2
print()
